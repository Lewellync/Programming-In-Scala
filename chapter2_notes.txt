2.2

Two kinds of variables: val / var
  Val - once initialized, can never be reassigned.
  Var - like a non-final variable in Java.

Type inference in Scala lets the compiler figure out what type your variable is
unless you explicitly tell it what you want it to be. Because it's smarter than
you.

Type Inference :
  val greeting = "Hello World!"
Explicit Typing :
  val greeting: String = "Hello World!"

2.3

Function Definition :

def name_of_function(variable_1: Int, variable_2: String): Int = {}

If you want a function that takes no parameters and returns no interesting value:
  def greet() = println("Hello, world!")
Scala will interpret the return type as Unit, which is similar to Java's void.

2.5

i++ and ++i do not work in Scala for incrementing. It must be done as i = i + 1
or i += 1.

2.6

One of the main characteristics of a functional language is that functions are
first class constructs. This can be represented by function literals.

Function Literal :

(variable_1: Type, variable_2: Type) => variable_1 + variable_2

List of named parameters in parentheses, a right arrow, and the body of the
function.
