Traits are a fundamental part of code reuse in Scala. A trait encapsulates method
and field definitions which can be reused by mixing them into classes. Different
than class inheritance, a class can mix in any number of traits. They are similar
to interfaces, but have the capabilities of abstract classes.

TLDR: Traits are like way more powerful Java interfaces, and act pretty similarly
when you get down to the nuts and bolts of it all.
