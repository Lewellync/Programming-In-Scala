Vocabulary :

Coupling - the extent to which various parts of a program rely on other parts.

Notes :

When working on a program, especially large ones, it is important to minimize
coupling. Low coupling reduces the risk that a small change in one part of the program
can have devastating consequences in another part. One way to minimize this risk
is to write in a modular style. Divide the program into a number of smaller modules
that exist independent of any other module.

This is the decision behind the creation of packages and imports, and while they
are similar the implementations in Java, it is important to have an understanding
of them in scala.

Scala code exists in the Java platform's global hierarchy of packages. All code we've
written so far has existed in the 'unnamed' package. Because Scala exists within Java,
it is recommended to follow Java's reverse-domain-name convention for packages.
