4.1 - Classes, Fields, and Methods

By default, instance variables are public. In Java this would be "public var",
in Scala it is just "var". Note, instance variables should be private to
preserve the validity of an object.

A method that returns Unit are executed for their side effects. A side effect
is defined as mutating state somewhere external to the method or performing an
I/O action. A method that is only executed for its side effects is known as a
procedure.

Chaining infix operators should put the operator at the end of the line.
