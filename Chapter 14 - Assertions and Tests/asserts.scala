/*
  Another way is to check the widths at the end of the widen method, before you return
  the value. You can accomplish  this by storing the result in a val, performing
  an assertion on the result, then mentioning the val last so the result is returned
  if the assertion succeeds. This can be done very concicsely as in 14.2

  The ensuring method can be used with any result type, and takes one argument; a
  predicate function that takes a result type and returns Boolean, and passes the
  result to the predicate. If the predicate returns true, ensruing will return an error.

  In the example, the underscore is a placeholder for an argument passed to the predicate;
  the Element result of the widen method.
