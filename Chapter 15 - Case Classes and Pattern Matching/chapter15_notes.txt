Case classes and pattern matching are two constructs that support writing regular,
non-encapsulated data structures. These two constructs are particularly helpful for
tree-like recursive data.

 == 15.1 ==

Let's get our feet wet with the concept and basic idea behind mapping with a simple
example concerning ourselves with manipulating arithmetic expressions.

-- L 15.1

The above hierarchy includes an abstract base class and four subclasses, one for each
kind of expression being considered. The bodies of all five classes are empty, as previously
mentioned, in Scala you can leave out the braces around an empty class body if you wish.

Case Classes
The other noteworthy thing 15.1 is that each subclass has a case modifier. Classes with
such a modifier are called case classes (go figure). Using this modifier gives you that
sweet sweet syntactic sugar.

It adds a factory method with the name of the class. You can write 'Var("x")' instead of
'new Var("x")'. These factory methods are useful when nested, because there are no 'new'
keywords sprinkled throught the code. For instance:

val v = Var("x")
val op = BinOp("+", Number(1), v)

Another syntactic convenience is that all arguments in the parameter list of a case class
implicitly get a val prefix, so they are maintained as fields. The compiler adds "natural"
implementations of methods toString, hashCode, and equals to your class. Lastly, the compiler
adds a copy method to your class for making modified copies.

Very little tradeoffs for huge benefits.

-- L 15.2

The right-hand side of simplifyTop is a match expression, which is like switches but
is written after the selector expression.

A constant pattern like "-" or 1 matches value that are equal to the constant with
respect to ==

A variable pattern like 'e' matches every value. The variable then refers to that
value in the right hand side of the case clause.

A wildcard pattern(_) also matches every value, but does not introduce a variable name
to refer to that value. In 15.2, the default case does nothing with the expression.

A constructor pattern looks like 'UnOp("-", e)'. This pattern matches all values of type
UnOp whose first argument matches "-" and whose second matches e. Note that the arguments
to the constructor are themselves pattern.

A match must always have a default case, otherwise it will throw a MatchError.
-- L 15.3

 == 15.2 ==

Let's go back and look at each pattern introduced in 15.1 in detail and understand
how each of them works.

Wildcard Pattern
The wildcard pattern (_) matches any object whatsoever, as shown at the end of 15.2
and 15.3. Wildcards can also be used to ignore parts of an object that you do not
care about. For example, in 15.3, we don't care about the operations, just that it
is a BinOp. The code can be rewritten and is in 15.4 to include wildcards.

Constant Patterns
A constant pattern only matches itself, ever. Any literal can be a constant, as shown
in 15.5. Important to note that Nil, a singleton object, is a pattern that matches
only the empty list.

Variable Patterns
A variable pattern matches the same as a wildcard, but binds the variable to whatever
the object is. You can then use the variable to act on the object further, as shown
in 15.6.
