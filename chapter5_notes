5.1 - Some Basic Types

5.2 - Literals

String exists as the Java version, all other basic types are in scala package.
Number begins with "Ox" it's base 16, non-zero character is base 10, if it end in
"L" it's a Long. Scala doesn't support octals. A decimal point followed by an e
and an exponent are floating points in scientific notation.

Blah blah blah Scala has literals just like Java. Big whoop. Note not caring
about this section will invariably bite me in the ass.

String literals, these are neat. You know how you have to escape special chars
like ",', and /? Surround them by triple quotes (""") and Scala recognizes this
as a raw string, and will not interpret any of the special chars inside. You'll
probably get weird margins on multiline prints though, so remember to use
.stripMargin on your raw strings.

Symbols are also a thing, but I don't know much about them. Symbol literals are
typically used in situations where you would just use an identifier in a
dynamically typed language (like updating a record in a db).b
