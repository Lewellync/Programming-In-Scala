Chapter 7 - Built-in Control Structures

Almost all of Scala's built in control structures result in a value. This is in
accordance with functional programming. You can also view this as the logical
conclusion of the trend in imperative programming languages; look at ternary
operators like '?' in Java. It functions like an if statement but returns a
value, mind blown.

If-Statements

If you want to do nested iteration (multiple if statements cascading after one
another inside a for), you need to remember to place a semi-colon after all ifs
besides the last one. You can get around this by using curly brackets instead of
parens for the for statement.
