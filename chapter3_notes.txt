3.7

Just like Java, you use the 'new' keyword to instantiate an object.

If you create an array or collection with the 'val' keyword, the variable will
always point to the same object instance with the parameters it was initialized
with. However, you can modify the elements contained within, so the array itself
is mutable.

General rule of Scala, if a method takes only one parameter, you can call it
without a dot or paren. Example :

  for (0 to 2)
  =
  for ((0).to(2))

Operators in Scala are not operators in the traditional sense.

  1 + 2
  =
  (1).+(2)

Operators in Scala are just method calls. Most things are method calls. I mean
like almost everything is a method call. When you access an array or give it a
value, you're calling a method on the array class.

  greetStrings(i)
  =
  greetStrings.apply(i)

  greetStrings(0) = "Hello"
  =
  greetStrings.update(0, "Hello")
